# Experiment-13
# Aim
To study and implement Constructor Overloading
# Theory

In C++, we can have multiple constructors with the same name as long as they each have a different set of arguments.This is known as Constructor Overloading. It is similarto function overloading. 
Constructor overloading in object-oriented programming enables a class to have multiple constructors with the same name but different parameters. This means that you can create objects in various ways by passing different numbers or types of arguments. The program automatically selects the appropriate constructor based on the arguments provided, making it simple to create and initialize objects.
CODES:

1. 
```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
class room
{
    private: 
    double length, breadth;
    public:
    room()
    {
        length = 8.2;
        breadth = 2.2;
    }
    room(double l, double b)
    {
        length = l;
        breadth = b; 
    }
    room(double len)
    {
        length = len;
        breadth = 4.2;
    }
    double calculateArea()
    {
        return length * breadth;
    }
};
int main()
{
    room room1;
    cout << "When no argument is passed:" << endl;
    cout << "Area of room = " << room1.calculateArea() << endl;
    room room2(8.2, 2.2);
    cout << "\nWhen (8.2, 2.2) is passed:" << endl;
    cout << "Area of room = " << room2.calculateArea() << endl;
    room room3(4.2);
    cout << "\nWhen breadth is fixed to 4.2 and (4.2) is passed:" << endl;
    cout << "Area of room = " << room3.calculateArea() << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
